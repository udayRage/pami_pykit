Utility database which is going to be loaded must contain 3 tuples (Here each tuple should be separated by ':') such as,
 collection of items (separated by ','), total utility of the transaction, and collection of utility of each item
 (separated by ',')

for example: a,b,c,d:20:5,5,6,4
             a,d,e:15:5,4,6
             c,d,e:16:6,4,6
