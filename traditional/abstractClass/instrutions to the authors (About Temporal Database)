Temporal database which is going to be loaded must contain 2 tuples such as, Time stamp and set of items separated by a
delimiter (say ",") (i.e., first column should represent the temporal information and remaining columns represents the
set of items)

for example: 1,a,b,c,d
             2,a,d,e
             4,c,d,e
