How to execute the code:
We have created an abstract class named “freqeuntPatterns” inside the “abstractFrequentPatterns.py” python file.
Therefore, every program has to import this file and needs to extend the abstract class as follows: from traditional.abstractClass.abstractFrequentPatterns
import *
class AlgoCorelFFI ():
	Complete code along with the implementation of the given abstract methods and variables available in the abstract class ‘fuzzyfrequentPatterns’.
1. Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) Process:
	1.1.Import our package and initialize the method called 'Fuzzy Frequent' using the input file path/input file and minimum support (It has to be given in terms of count of total number of transactions in the input database/file).
	1.2.Then call the method 'startMine' using the following command 
		import Fuzzy Frequent as Myap
		fp= Myap.AlgoCorelFFI("input","output",minsup,ratio)
		fp.startMine()
		output is displayed as follows:
		Fuzzy-Frequent patterns were generated successfully using Fuzzy Frequent algorithm.
		For example:
			If we execute the following command:
			import Fuzzy Frequent as Myap
			fp = Myap.AlgoCorelFFI("inp","outp",4,0.2)
			fp.startMine()
			output is displayed as follows:
			Fuzzy-Frequent patterns were generated successfully using Fuzzy Frequent algorithm.
2. If we want to know the amount of RSS memory consumed by the Fuzzy Frequent algorithm:
	2.1.Complete the FPM Process mentioned in (1)
	2.2.Then call the method 'getMemoryRSS' using the following command:
		import Fuzzy Frequent as Myap
		fp = Myap.AlgoCorelFFI("input","output",minsup,ratio)
		fp.startMine()
		variable = fp.getMemoryRSS()
		output is displayed as follows:
		Fuzzy-Frequent patterns were generated successfully using Fuzzy Frequent algorithm.
	 Total amount of RSS memory consumed by the program will be computed and returned to the called function.
	For example:
		If we execute the following command:
		import Fuzzy Frequent as Myap
		fp = Myap.AlgoCorelFFI("inp","outp",4,0.2)
		fp.startMine()
		memoryRSS = fp.getMemoryRSS()
		output is displayed as follows:
		Fuzzy-Frequent patterns were generated successfully using Fuzzy Frequent algorithm.
	  Total amount of RSS memory consumed by the program will be computed and returned to the variable called ' memoryRSS.'
3. If we want to know the runtime taken by the Fuzzy Frequent algorithm created by us:
	3.1.Complete the FPM Process mentioned in (1)
	3.2.Then call the method 'getRuntime' using the following command:
		import Fuzzy Frequent as Myap
		fp = Myap.AlgoCorelFFI("input","output",minsup,ratio)
		fp.startMine()
		variable = fp.getRuntime()
		output is displayed as follows:
		Fuzzy-Frequent patterns were generated successfully using Fuzzy Frequent algorithm.
		 Total runtime taken by the program in seconds will be computed and returned to the called function.
		For example:
			If we execute the following command:
		import Fuzzy Frequent as Myap
		fp= Myap.AlgoCorelFFI("inp","outp",4,0.2)
		fp.startMine()
		run = fpgetRuntime()
		output is displayed as follows:
		Fuzzy-Frequent patterns were generated successfully using Fuzzy Frequent algorithm.
		 Total runtime taken by the program in seconds will be computed and returned to the variable called 'run.'
